# Decentralized Ultra-Low Latency Streaming Server

A decentralized media server designed to handle media streaming on a global scale, making it suitable for large-scale applications but with minimal cost.

It is developed by 8xFF, a group of independent developers who are passionate about building a new generation of media server and network infrastructure with decentralization in mind. While we have received support from various companies and individuals, we are not affiliated with any specific company. 8xFF is a community-driven project, and we welcome anyone interested in contributing to join us.

For a deep dive into the technical aspects of network architecture, please refer to our [Smart-Routing](https://github.com/8xFF/atm0s-sdn/blob/master/docs/smart_routing.md)

(Above is a demo video of the version used by Bluesea Network)

## Project Status: Refactoring

We are actively refactoring entire media server and network stack with [sans-io-runtime](https://github.com/8xff/sans-io-runtime) for better performance. If you are looking for an older version, please check out the [legacy branch](https://github.com/8xFF/atm0s-media-server/tree/legacy).

## Features

- üöÄ Powered by Rust with memory safety and performance.
- High availability by being fully decentralized, with no central controller.
- üõ∞Ô∏è Multi-zone support, high scalability.
- Support encodings: H264, Vp8, Vp9, H265 (Coming soon), AV1 (Coming soon)
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows.
- Decentralized WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)
- Easy to deploy: single binary, Docker, or Kubernetes
- Easy to scale: global pubsub network, similar to [Cloudflare interconnected network](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-cloudflare-calls/))

- From Docker

```bash
docker run --net=host ghcr.io/8xff/atm0s-media-server:master --help
```

- Build from source

```
cargo build --release --package atm0s-media-server
./target/release/atm0s-media-server --help
```

### Run

Run first WebRTC node:

```bash
atm0s-media-server --http-port 3001 --zone-index=101 webrtc
```

After node1 started it will print out the node address like `101@/ip4/192.168.1.10/udp/10101/ip4/192.168.1.10/tcp/10101`, you can use it as a seed node for other nodes.

Run second WebRTC node:

```bash
atm0s-media-server --http-port 3002 --zone-index=102 --seeds FIRST_NODE_ADDR webrtc
```

Now two nodes will form a cluster and can be used for media streaming.

First media-server: http://localhost:3001/samples/whip/whip.html

Second media-server: http://localhost:3002/samples/whep/whep.html

You can use [Pregenerated-Token](./docs/getting-started/quick-start/whip-whep.md) to publish and play stream.

![Demo Screen](./docs/imgs/demo-screen.jpg)

Each node also has embedded monitoring page at `http://localhost:3001/dashboard/` and `http://localhost:3002/dashboard/`
