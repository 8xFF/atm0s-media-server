# 8xFF Media Server: Distributed Ultra-Low Latency Streaming Server

A distributed media server designed to handle media streaming at a global-scale, making it suitable for large-scale applications but with minimal cost. It is designed with [SAN-I/O](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) in mind.

TODO: image about endpoints + connections

## Features
  - üöÄ Powered by Rust with memory safety and performance.
  - High availability by being fully distributed, with no central controller.
  - üõ∞Ô∏è Multi-zone support, high scalability.
  - Support encodings: H264, Vp8, Vp9, H265 (Coming soon), AV1 (Coming soon)
  - Cross platform: Linux, MacOs, Windows.
  - Decentralized WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)
  - Modern, full-featured client SDKs
    - [x] [Vanilla Javascript]()
    - [x] [Rust]()
    - [x] [React]()
    - [x] [React Native]()
    - [ ] Flutter
    - [ ] iOS Native
    - [ ] Android Native
  - Easy to deploy: single binary, Docker, or Kubernetes
  - Advanced features including:
    - [ ] Audio Mix-Minus (WIP)
    - [x] Simulcast/SVC
    - [x] SFU
    - [x] SFU Cascading (each streams is global PubSub channel, similar to [Cloudflare interconnected network](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-cloudflare-calls/))
    - [ ] Recording
    - [x] RTMP
    - [ ] SIP (WIP)
    - [x] WebRTC

## Architecture

- Global Gateway
- Inner zone gateway
- Media Server
- Connector (connect to custom logic)

TODO: Diagram

## Getting started
To get started, you can either:
- Start from docker

```bash
docker run --net=host 8xff/media-server:latest
```

- Download prebuild

```bash
wget ....
```

- Or build from source

```
cargo build --package ...
```

### Start a single node

```
RUST_LOG=info media-server --enable-demos
```

After that we can access `http://localhost:3000/demos` to see all demos

### Start multi-nodes

```bash
RUST_LOG=info media-server --node-id 1 --sdn-port 5001 --enable-demos
```

```bash
RUST_LOG=info media-server --node-id 2 --sdn-port 5002 --neighbour-addr udp+p2p://NODE1_IP:5001 --enable-demos
```

After that we can access demo from both nodes:

```
http://NODE1_IP:3000/demos
or
http://NODE2_IP:3000/demos
```

Whenerever user access to demos on node1 or node2, users will see each other like single nodes

### Start RTMP nodes

We can enable rtmp by setting `--rtmp-port 1935` when starting a node, by that way we can publish rtmp stream by using any RTMP Client like OBS to publish to bellow stream:

- Server: `rtmp://NODE_IP:1935/live`
- Stream Key: `app?room=ROOM_ID&peer=PEER_ID`

Stream codec should be config with h264 no B-Frame with ultra-low latency option.

More info in [Publish Demo]()

### Start SIP gateway
