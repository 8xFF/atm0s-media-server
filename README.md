# Decentralized Ultra-Low Latency Streaming Server

A decentralized media server designed to handle media streaming on a global scale, making it suitable for large-scale applications but with minimal cost. It is designed with [SAN-I/O](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) in mind.

For a deep dive into the technical aspects of network architecture, please refer to our [Smart-Routing](https://github.com/8xFF/atm0s-sdn/blob/master/docs/smart_routing.md)

## Getting started
To get started, you can either:
- Start from Docker

```bash
docker run --net=host 8xff/atm0s-media-server:latest
```

- Download prebuild

```bash
wget https://github.com/8xFF/atm0s-media-server/releases/download/latest/atm0s-media-server-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

- Or build from source

```
cargo build --release --package atm0s-media-server
```

### Prepare access token

- Pregenerated token for default config:

WHIP: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb29tIjoiZGVtbyIsInBlZXIiOiJwdWJsaXNoZXIiLCJwcm90b2NvbCI6IldoaXAiLCJwdWJsaXNoIjp0cnVlLCJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOmZhbHNlLCJ0cyI6MTcwMzc1MjI5NDEyMn0.EfRZK7eHMZ-TCG23-jst8TAKVfbiQhX21cxB2mSznAM`

WHEP: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb29tIjoiZGVtbyIsInBlZXIiOm51bGwsInByb3RvY29sIjoiV2hlcCIsInB1Ymxpc2giOmZhbHNlLCJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOnRydWUsInRzIjoxNzAzNzUyMzE1NTgyfQ.6XS0gyZWJ699BUN0rXtlLH-0SvgtMXJeXIDtJomxnig`

RTMP: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb29tIjoiZGVtbyIsInBlZXIiOiJydG1wIiwicHJvdG9jb2wiOiJSdG1wIiwicHVibGlzaCI6dHJ1ZSwic3Vic2NyaWJlIjpmYWxzZSwidHMiOjE3MDM3NTIzMzU2OTV9.Gj0uCxPwqsFfMFLX8Cufrsyhtb7vedNp3GeUtKQCk3s`

SDK: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb29tIjoiZGVtbyIsInBlZXIiOm51bGwsInByb3RvY29sIjoiV2VicnRjIiwicHVibGlzaCI6dHJ1ZSwic3Vic2NyaWJlIjp0cnVlLCJ0cyI6MTcwMzc1MjM1NTI2NH0.llwwbSwVTsyFgL_jYCdoPNVdOiC2jbtNb4uxxE-PU7A`

Or create with token-generated api

```
atm0s-media-server --http-port 3100 token-generate
```

After that, you can access http://localhost:3100/ui/ to create a token by yourself. The default cluster token is `insecure`

### Start a webrtc node only

For simple testing, we can start a single node which supports Webrtc for testing with Whip and Whep

```
atm0s-media-server --http-port 3200 webrtc
```

After that, we can access `http://localhost:3000/samples` to see all embedded samples

### Start entire cluster

In cluster mode, each module needs to be on a separate node. This setup can run on a single machine or multiple machines, whether they are connected via a public or private network.

The Inner-Gateway module routes user traffic to the most suitable media server node.
```bash
atm0s-media-server --node-id 10 --sdn-port 10010 --http-port 3000 gateway
```

Afterward, the gateway prints out its address in the format: 10@/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/10001/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10001. This address serves as the seed node for other nodes joining the cluster.

The WebRTC module serves users with either an SDK or a Whip, Whep client.
```bash
atm0s-media-server --node-id 21 --http-port 3001 --seeds ABOVE_GATEWAY_ADDR webrtc
```

The RTMP module serves users with an RTMP broadcaster such as OBS or Streamyard.
```bash
atm0s-media-server --node-id 30 --seeds ABOVE_GATEWAY_ADDR rtmp
```

The SIP module serves users with a SIP endpoint for integration with telephone providers.
```bash
atm0s-media-server --node-id 40 --seeds ABOVE_GATEWAY_ADDR sip
```

You can now access the sample page at the URL: http://localhost:3000/samples/webrtc/. There, you will find two pages: Whip Broadcast and Whep Viewer.

Please note that the inner-gateway selects nodes based on usage, routing to the same media-server instance until it reaches high usage. For testing media exchange between systems, you can start more than one WebRTC module as needed.

```
atm0s-media-server --node-id 22 --http-port 3002 --seeds ABOVE_GATEWAY_ADDR webrtc
atm0s-media-server --node-id 23 --http-port 3003 --seeds ABOVE_GATEWAY_ADDR webrtc
```

Afterward, you can directly access the samples on each WebRTC node:

First media-server: http://localhost:3001/samples/
Second media-server: http://localhost:3002/samples/
Third media-server: http://localhost:3003/samples/

![Demo Screen](./docs/imgs/demo-screen.jpg)

Each node also exposes a metric dashboard here:

- Gateway: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/
- Media1: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/
- Media2: http://localhost:3002/dashboard/
- Media3: http://localhost:3003/dashboard/

![Monitoring](./docs/imgs/demo-monitor.png)

### Start RTMP session

Instead of publishing with the Whip client, we can use any RTMP client, such as OBS, to publish to the following stream:

- Server: `rtmp://RTMP_NODE_IP:1935/live`
- Stream Key: `above generated rtmp token`

The stream codec should be configured with h264, without B-frames, and with the ultra-low latency option, as shown in the screenshot below.
