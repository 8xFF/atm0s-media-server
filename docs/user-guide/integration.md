# Integration

We support integration with other systems through the following methods:

- Token generation logic and client SDK.
- HTTP API: for managing, kicking, and making calls.
- Handling events over a message queue. Currently, only Nats is supported, but it can easily be expanded to support more types.
- Handling SIP integration with Hooks: Auth, Register, Unregister, and Invite.

## Token generation logic and client SDK

The approach of token generate and validate is media-server dont hold database about generated token or dont need to ask any other service to validate token. The token is validated on each nodes by only config. The token is generated by external server itself or using token-generate api of media-server.

Currently we support only static cluster secret, but it will be extended more in the future. The potential options are: public-private key,  hierarchical key (bip32).

Supported mechanism:

| Type | Token | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static Secret | [JWT](https://jwt.io/) | Done |
| Public Private Key | [JWT](https://jwt.io/) | TODO |
| Hierarchical Key | [JWT](https://jwt.io/) | TODO |

## External event handling with message queue

For processing events, we use a message queue. Currently, only Nats is supported, but it can easily be expanded to support more types. Each time a room or peer event occurs, it will be sent to the message queue. The event will be processed by the connector node.

Supported events please see [Protobuf](/packages/protocol/src/media_endpoint_log.proto))


## SIP integration with Hooks

For SIP integration, we use Hooks. Currently, only HTTP Hooks is supported. Each time a SIP event occurs, it will be sent to the Hook Endpoint. For make outgoing call, external service need to send invite request to HTTP endpoint of SIP.

Hooks:

| Type | Endpoint | Body | Response | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | /hooks/auth | body here | return SIP HA1 hash or reject | Done |
| Register | /hooks/register | body here | Save to db  | Done |
| Unregister | /hooks/unregister | body here | Remove from db | Done |
| Invite | /hooks/invite | body here | return action: reject, or move to room | Done |

Actions:

Actions:

| Type | Endpoint| Body | Respinse | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Invite | /actions/invite | body here | response here | For creating outgoing call |


### Working flow

#### Register

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant sip-client
    participant atm0s-sip-server
    participant 3rd-hooks
    sip-client ->> atm0s-sip-server: Register
    atm0s-sip-server ->> 3rd-hooks: post /hooks/auth
    3rd-hooks ->> atm0s-sip-server: return md5(user:realm:password)
    atm0s-sip-server ->> sip-client: return OK or ERR
    atm0s-sip-server ->> 3rd-hooks: post /hooks/register includes session_id (if above is OK)
```

#### Incoming call

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant sip-client
    participant atm0s-sip-server
    participant 3rd-hooks
    sip-client->>atm0s-sip-server: incomming call
    atm0s-sip-server ->> 3rd-hooks: post /hooks/invite includes from, to
    3rd-hooks ->> atm0s-sip-server: return action: Reject, Accept, WaitOthers, includes room info
    atm0s-sip-server->atm0s-sip-server: create endpoint and join room if Accept or WaitOthers
    atm0s-sip-server ->> sip-client: return Busy if above Reject
    atm0s-sip-server ->> sip-client: return Accept if above Accept
    atm0s-sip-server ->> sip-client: return Ringing if above WaitOthers
```

#### Outgoing call

Call to client (Zoiper or Linphone app ...)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant sip-client
    participant atm0s-sip-server
    participant 3rd-hooks
    3rd-hooks ->> atm0s-sip-server: post /sip/invite/client includes session_id, room_info
    atm0s-sip-server->>sip-client: outgoing call
    atm0s-sip-server->atm0s-sip-server: create endpoint and join room as connecting
    atm0s-sip-server ->> 3rd-hooks: return call_id
    sip-client->>atm0s-sip-server: accept
    atm0s-sip-server->atm0s-sip-server: switch endpoint to connected
```
