In atm0s-media, extra_data and metadata is used with same goal is providing addition data beside of only room and peer. We use 2 terms extra_data and metadata with some difference:

- extra_data: a string which is embedded to peer token, which can not be changed by client
- metadata: a string which is embedded to peer or track by client. In there peer metadata is set at join-room step, track metadata is set at publish track step.
