# Userdata and metadata

Userdata and metadata is used with same goal is providing addition data beside of only room and peer. We use 2 terms userdata and metadata with some difference:

- Userdata: a string which is embedded to peer token, which can not be changed by client
- Metadata: a string which is embedded to peer or track by client. In there peer metadata is set at join-room step, track metadata is set at publish track step.
