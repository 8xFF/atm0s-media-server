# Atm0s Media Server

A decentralized media server designed to handle media streaming on a global scale, making it suitable for large-scale applications but with minimal cost.

It is developed by 8xFF, a group of independent developers who are passionate about building a new generation of media server and network infrastructure with decentralization in mind. While we have received support from various companies and individuals, we are not affiliated with any specific company. 8xFF is a community-driven project, and we welcome anyone interested in contributing to join us.
