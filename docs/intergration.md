# Integration

We support integration with other systems through the following methods:

- Token generation logic and client SDK.
- HTTP API: for managing, kicking, and making calls.
- Handling events over a message queue. Currently, only Nats is supported, but it can easily be expanded to support more types.
- Handling SIP integration with Hooks: Auth, Register, Unregister, and Invite.
