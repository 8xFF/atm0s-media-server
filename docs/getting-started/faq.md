### What are the goals for this project?

Our goals for this project can be summarized as follows:

- **Goal 1**: Cluster: Create a global decentralized media server cluster with multiple zones.
- **Goal 2**: Market: Develop a sharing marketplace for the media server, enabling resource sharing and monetization. This will help scale the media server cluster during peak times and reduce costs during off-peak times. In the feature marketplace fees will be used to fund the development of the project.
- **Goal 3**: Serverless: Establish a network between users, where servers only act as fallbacks. This approach aims to significantly reduce infrastructure costs and scale to infinity.
