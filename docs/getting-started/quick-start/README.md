# Quick Start

This will help you to get started with the project.

After installation, you can start testing the server with some ways:

- Using embedded [Whip and Whep](./whip-whep.md) client
- Using [RTMP broadcaster](./rtmp.md) like OBS
- Using [WebRTC SDK](./webrtc-sdk.md)
- Deploy [sample applications](./sample-application.md)
